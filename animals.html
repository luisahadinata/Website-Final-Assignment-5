                <p class="stories-text">Sien Nen is a 58-year-old elephant. Sien Nen, which means ‘Diamond Palace’ in Burmese, helps her owner by pulling logs through the jungle.Her owner noticed small bumps covering Sien Nen’s skin, which was causing her irritation. Our vets examined Sien Nen and diagnosed a skin disease, caused by a blood born parasite. This disease was transmitted by a fly bite and is most common during the rainy season when flies are breeding. Although thankfully the disease is not life-threatening, Sien Nen had started scratching as a result, which can lead to far more serious skin wounds over time.</p>

                <p class="stories-text">Karim is a young dromedary camel who was bitten on his neck by another camel. After developing a painful-looking wound following the bite, his worried owner Ahmed Ben Ahmed brought eight month old Karim to the mobile clinic in Noueil to ask SPANA vets for their help. Karim is too young to work yet, but when he gets older, he will help Ahmed earn a living by working as an essential form of transport, carrying both goods and people. Our vets examined Karim and found that the wound on his neck was very inflamed and infected and he had developed a painful abscess.</p>

                <h3>MEET MARWA</h3>
                <p class="stories-text">Marwa is a 26-year-old donkey who is suffering as a result of a problem with her foot.SPANA vets inspected her carefully and found that she had stepped on a piece of sharp metal that had penetrated the sole of her foot and formed an abscess. Immediately they administered a painkiller and began working on her foot—draining the abscess and soaking the foot using a special rubber boot to help draw out any infection. The boot was invented by the Chemaia team and has helped them no-end as they were finding it increasingly difficult to keep animals still whilst soaking wounds to their feet.</p>
