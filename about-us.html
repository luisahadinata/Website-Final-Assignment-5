        <p class="mission-text">In 1923, Kate Hosali and her daughter Nina set off for North Africa as tourists; it was a journey that would last a lifetime. As they travelled through the countryside, passing bustling souks, remote communities and rural farms, they were inspired by much of what they saw. But they were also struck by the awful sight of donkeys, mules and camels – malnourished, weak, buckling under the weight of huge loads; suffering with wounds inflicted by poorly fitting harnesses.</p>
